# MongoDB_SNS_API
Description

Through this project, I was given the opportunity to apply what I had learned about NoSQL, specifically how to use MongoDB along with mongoose. It was interesting to compare and contrast how the CRUD methods, and data structure differs from a SQL style database. It was a bit challenging getting used to the subdocuments structure of MongoDB, but very interesting. With this application, an individual could begin to set up the database and API for a Social Network and allows users to find friends, create a user and a post, react/delete the user or post, and much more.
